# AI-for-disabled
SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT 
This project is based on an artificially intelligent robot which will help disabled people in their activities, cognitive skills. The robot will help people with special needs to reach their real potential by individualized training and focusing more on the areas which they specifically need to improve. This project uses the azure services which are Artificial Intelligence, computer vision and speech to text, voice assissted technology.
•	voice assisted technology which can enables individuals with disabilities to access information much easier, all just by speaking to their devices. Through simple voice commands they can control nearly every aspect of their home from switching on/off lights, adjusting the temperature, cleaning, setting alarms and reminders, playing music, making to-do lists, and providing real-time information
•	installing Natural language processing(NLP) and speech to text and text to speech for people with speech impediments
•	voice systems which can learn speaker’s pronunciation over time and translate the user’s words into clear and normalized speech
•	can use computer vision which will allow system to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs and take actions or make recommendations based on that information
•	For teaching cognitive skills AI tool i.e. Theory of Mind can be used- the ability of the human mind to attribute mental states to others.
